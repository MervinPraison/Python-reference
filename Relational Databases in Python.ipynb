    "SQLAlchemy can be used to automatically load tables from a database using something called reflection. Reflection is the process of reading the database and building the metadata based on that information. It's the opposite of creating a Table by hand and is very useful for working with existing databases. To perform reflection, you need to import the Table object from the SQLAlchemy package. Then, you use this Table object to read your table from the engine and autoload the columns. Using the Table object in this manner is a lot like passing arguments to a function. For example, to autoload the columns with the engine, you have to specify the keyword arguments autoload=True and autoload_with=engine to Table().\n",

To work around that issue, you can get blocks of rows from the ResultProxy by using the .fetchmany() method inside a loop. With .fetchmany(), give it an argument of the number of records you want.
